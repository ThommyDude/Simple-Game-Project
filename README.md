# Simple-Game-Project
Followed a simple tutorial for creating a simple Incremental (Idle) game.

## What can you do?
You can Hunt for meat, Chop wood, Mine rock!

### Yeah, but why?
Currently, the **meat** is used to _hire_ hunters, woodcutters and miners!

### And what do THEY do?!
Hunters generate meat, Woodcutters generate wood and Miners generate rock.

### Are those resources used for anything?
Look... I did this on a friday evening, this is (at this point) all you can do, the wood and rock are currently  _*completely*_ useless!

## Will you actually continue working on this?
That's the plan. How far I'll actually get is still a big :question: I'm afraid, but this MIGHT turn into something I'll turn in at school, so who knows? _I sure don't!_
